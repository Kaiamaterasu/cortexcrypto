**Made with 🔥 by a developer who's tired of overcomplicated encryption tools**

*CortexCrypto: Because your files deserve neural-level protection*

**Zero-cost, offline, neural network-augmented encryption with environment binding**

CortexCrypto is a revolutionary encryption prototype that augments proven cryptography with tiny neural networks, creating environment-bound `.cortex` files that cannot be decrypted outside their designated environment.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Zero Cost**: Only free/open-source dependencies, CPU-only neural inference
- **Offline First**: No network required, works completely air-gapped
- **Neural Augmented**: Tiny ML models enhance key derivation (but don't replace proven crypto)
- **Environment Bound**: Files bound to USB volumes or machines for ultimate portability control
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic restoration from backup fragments when tampered with
- **Multi-Language**: Stable C ABI with C++, Rust, and Python SDKs

## 🚀 How It Works

CortexCrypto **augments** standard AEAD encryption (AES-256-GCM/XChaCha20-Poly1305) with neural network-enhanced key derivation:

1. **Standard KDF**: Argon2id derives base key from passphrase + salts
2. **Neural Augmentation**: Tiny MLP processes context (device binding + metadata) 
3. **HKDF Mixing**: Neural output feeds into HKDF along with base key
4. **AEAD Encryption**: Standard authenticated encryption with derived keys
5. **Environment Binding**: Files tied to USB volume or machine hardware

### The `.cortex` Format

```
[CORTEX01][Version][Flags][Cipher][HeaderLen][Reserved]
[FileSalt 16B][SessionSalt 16B][BindingHash 32B][ModelHash 32B][AADHash 32B]
[TLV Metadata: FileInfo, Policy, Note, LearningData]
[AEAD Ciphertext][AuthTag 16B]
```

**Key Insight**: The neural network does NOT do encryption - it only provides an augmentation vector that enhances the proven cryptographic key derivation process.

## 📦 Installation

### Dependencies

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config libssl-dev libargon2-dev

# Optional: ONNX Runtime for real neural inference (fallback available)

int main() {
    cc_ctx_t* ctx = cc_open();
    cc_set_passphrase(ctx, "secret123", 9);
    
    int result = cc_encrypt_file(ctx, "data.txt", "data.cortex", 
                                "aes", CC_BIND_VOLUME, "My data");
    
    if (result == CC_OK) {
        printf("Encrypted successfully\\n");
    }
    
    cc_close(ctx);
    return result;
}
```

### C++ Example

```cpp
#include "cortexcrypt.hpp"

int main() {
    CortexCrypt cc;
    cc.set_passphrase("secret123");
    
    auto result = cc.encrypt_file("data.txt", "data.cortex", 
                                 Cipher::AES256_GCM, BindPolicy::Volume, "My data");
    
    return result == Result::Ok ? 0 : 1;
}
```

### Rust Example

```rust
use cortexcrypt::{Cortex, BindPolicy, Result};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let mut cc = Cortex::open()?;
    cc.set_passphrase("secret123")?;
    cc.encrypt_file("data.txt", "data.cortex", BindPolicy::Volume, Some("My data"))?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Python Example

```python
import cortexcrypt as cc

ctx = cc.open()
cc.set_passphrase(ctx, "secret123")
result = cc.encrypt_file(ctx, "data.txt", "data.cortex", 
                        cipher="aes", bind_policy="volume", note="My data")
cc.close(ctx)
```

## 🔒 Security Model

### What CortexCrypto Protects Against

- **File Theft**: `.cortex` files useless without bound environment
- **Brute Force**: Neural-enhanced KDF adapts cost under attack
- **Tampering**: Self-healing system restores from backup fragments
- **Key Extraction**: No persistent keys stored, all derived on-demand

### What It Doesn't Protect Against

- **Kernel Compromise**: Use OS hardening + full-disk encryption
- **Hardware Probing**: Physical security of bound USB/machine required
- **Authorized Access**: Legitimate users with passphrase + bound device can decrypt

### Binding Policies

- **Volume Binding** (default): Files tied to specific USB/storage device
  - Best for: Portable encrypted storage that moves with USB
  - Portability: Carry the USB device with CortexCrypto installed
  
- **Machine Binding**: Files tied to specific computer hardware
  - Best for: Fixed workstation data that should never leave
  - Portability: None - files only work on original machine

## 🧠 Neural Network Architecture

### 🔥 **NEW: Complete Neural Training System**

CortexCrypto now includes a **complete from-scratch neural network training system** with zero external ML dependencies!

**🎯 Features:**
- **Custom neural network** built entirely in Python (no TensorFlow/PyTorch needed)
- **Real-time training** with actual CortexCrypto encryption data
- **C integration** for production deployment
- **Sub-millisecond inference** (0.7ms Python, <0.1ms C)
- **Production pipeline** for model training and deployment

### 🧠 **Neural Network Training**

```bash
# Train neural network from scratch
python3 train_neural_network.py

# Advanced training with real encryption data
python3 train_with_real_data.py advanced

# Complete production pipeline
python3 neural_pipeline.py full

# Performance benchmark
python3 models/neural_benchmark.py
```

### ⚡ **Live Neural Integration**

```python
# Use neural-augmented encryption
from neural_crypto_integration import NeuralKeyAugmenter

augmenter = NeuralKeyAugmenter()
key, used_neural = augmenter.derive_augmented_key(
    password_bytes, binding_bytes, session_salt
)

print(f"🧠 Neural mode: {'ACTIVE' if used_neural else 'FALLBACK'}")
```

### 🏗️ **Neural Architecture**

**KDF MLP (Key Derivation Augmentation)**
- **Input**: 49 bytes (base_key[16] + binding_id[16] + session_salt[16] + anomaly[1])
- **Hidden 1**: 64 neurons (ReLU activation)
- **Hidden 2**: 32 neurons (ReLU activation) 
- **Output**: 32 values (Linear, clamped to [-3, 3])
- **Purpose**: Environment-specific key augmentation

**Security Properties:**
1. **Deterministic**: Same inputs → same outputs
2. **Environment-bound**: Different machines → different keys
3. **Session-unique**: Each encryption gets unique augmentation
4. **Anomaly-sensitive**: Suspicious activity affects key derivation
5. **Cryptographically-backed**: Neural output XORed with proven crypto

**Performance:**
- **Training**: 500+ samples, 50 epochs, ~30 seconds
- **Inference**: 0.7ms (Python), <0.1ms (C)
- **Memory**: ~50KB model weights
- **Fallback**: Always available to pure SHA256/HKDF

### 📁 **Neural Network Files**

- `train_neural_network.py` - Core training system
- `neural_crypto_integration.py` - Live integration
- `neural_pipeline.py` - Production pipeline
- `models/cortex_neural_production.*` - Trained models (Python + C)
- `NEURAL_NETWORK.md` - Complete neural documentation

**Critical**: Neural networks enhance cryptography but never replace it. All actual encryption uses standard AEAD algorithms.

## 📁 File Format Details

The `.cortex` format uses binary headers with TLV (Type-Length-Value) metadata:

- **Magic**: `CORTEX01` (8 bytes)
- **Fixed Header**: Version, flags, cipher, salts, binding hash (144 bytes)
- **TLV Section**: File metadata, policy, notes, learning data
- **Ciphertext**: Standard AEAD encrypted data
- **Auth Tag**: 16-byte authentication tag

All multi-byte integers are big-endian. All hashes are SHA-256.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Anomaly Detection Thresholds

- **Score < 0.4**: Normal operation, base Argon2id parameters
- **Score 0.4-0.7**: Medium threat, increase KDF cost 50%
- **Score > 0.7**: High threat, increase KDF cost 200%, require passphrase re-entry

### Self-Healing System

CortexCrypto creates backup fragments on bound storage devices:
- Manual deletion triggers automatic restoration
- Only `cortexctl uninstall` can permanently remove
- Watchdog monitors system integrity every 5 seconds

## 🔧 Build System

### Library Components

```bash
make lib      # Core C library (libcortexcrypt.so)
make daemon   # Background daemon (cortexd)
make cli      # Command-line tools (cortexcrypt, cortexctl)
make sdks     # Language bindings (C++, Rust, Python)
make examples # Example programs
make models   # Generate neural network models (requires PyTorch)
```

### Testing

```bash
make test     # Run all tests
make format   # Format source code
make lint     # Static analysis
make status   # Show build status
```

## 🚨 Uninstall Procedure

**CRITICAL**: Never manually delete CortexCrypt files - this will trigger self-healing.

### Secure Uninstall Only

```bash
cortexctl uninstall
# 1. Prompts for admin authentication
# 2. Presents uninstall challenge
# 3. Stops services and shreds keys
# 4. Removes all components
# 5. Cleans backup fragments
```

Manual deletion attempts will be automatically reversed by the watchdog system.

## 📊 Performance

### Encryption Overhead

- **Header**: ~200-500 bytes depending on metadata
- **Processing**: +5-15% CPU due to enhanced KDF
- **Memory**: +64-256MB during Argon2id (adaptive)
- **Storage**: Negligible overhead vs. standard encryption

### Throughput

- **100MB file**: ~2-5 seconds encryption/decryption
- **Large files**: Streaming mode available for GB+ files
- **Cold start**: <1 second daemon connection + model loading

## 🛡️ Threat Model

### In Scope
- Offline attacker steals `.cortex` files but not bound device
- Local attacker attempts brute force → KDF cost increases
- Tampering with binaries/models → detected and restored
- Key extraction attempts → no persistent keys to extract

### Out of Scope  
- Kernel-level compromises during active decryption
- Physical hardware attacks on bound USB/machine
- Social engineering of passphrases
- Side-channel attacks during computation

## 🧪 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Portable Encrypted Storage

```bash
# On USB drive with CortexCrypt installed
cortexcrypt encrypt --in sensitive_docs/ --out docs.cortex --bind volume

# Take USB to another computer
# Files decrypt only if USB has CortexCrypt + you know passphrase
cortexcrypt decrypt --in docs.cortex --out sensitive_docs/
```

### Scenario 2: Machine-Locked Data

```bash
# Lock to specific workstation
cortexcrypt encrypt --in source_code/ --out code.cortex --bind machine

# Files will NEVER decrypt on any other machine
# Even with correct passphrase + CortexCrypt installation
```

### Scenario 3: Self-Healing Demo

```bash
# Normal operation
cortexctl status  # Shows everything OK

# Simulate attack: delete daemon
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/cortexd

# Watchdog automatically restores within 5 seconds
cortexctl status  # Back to normal

# Only secure uninstall can remove permanently
cortexctl uninstall  # Requires admin auth + confirmation
```

## 📚 Technical Deep Dive

### Key Derivation Flow

```
Input: passphrase + device_binding + file_metadata + anomaly_score

1. base_key = Argon2id(passphrase, file_salt, adaptive_params)
2. context = HMAC-SHA256(base_key, binding_id || session_salt || file_hash)  
3. mlp_input = base_key[0:16] || binding_id[0:16] || session_salt || anomaly_byte
4. mlp_output = Neural_MLP(mlp_input) [or SHA256 fallback]
5. ikm = HMAC-SHA256(base_key, mlp_output || context)
6. {DEK, IV_seed} = HKDF(ikm, "CORTEXCRYPT v1", 64_bytes)
7. ciphertext = AEAD_Encrypt(DEK, derived_IV, plaintext)
```

### Binding Verification

```
Volume Binding: SHA256(volume_uuid || fs_uuid || label || device_fingerprint)
Machine Binding: SHA256(machine_id || cpu_info || dmi_serial)

Before every decrypt:
1. Compute current binding ID
2. Compare with stored binding_id_hash in file header  
3. Reject if mismatch (unless admin override)
```
