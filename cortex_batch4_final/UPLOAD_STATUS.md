## 🚀 **How to Complete Upload**

### Option 1: GitHub Token (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Create GitHub Personal Access Token:
# Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Generate new token with 'repo' permissions

# 2. Use token for authentication:
cd /home/failsafe/cortexcrypt
git push -u origin main
# Username: Kaiamaterasu
# Password: [paste your GitHub token]
```

### Option 2: SSH Key (Alternative)
```bash
# 1. Generate SSH key (if not exists):
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# 2. Add to GitHub:
# Copy key: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Add at: https://github.com/settings/keys

# 3. Change remote to SSH:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Kaiamaterasu/cortexcrypto.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Manual Upload
```bash
# Create zip of entire directory:
cd /home/failsafe
tar -czf cortexcrypto-neural.tar.gz cortexcrypt/

# Then manually upload via GitHub web interface
```
